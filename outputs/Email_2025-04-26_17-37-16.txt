Subject: Prospective Master's Student - [Insert your intended session]

Dear Professor Xie,

I am Arpon Kapuria, a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (2020-2024), from Bangladesh. I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a Master's degree under your supervision at New York University.

Your work on representation learning and multimodal LLMs resonates deeply with my research experiences and interests. Notably, your paper on "Deconstructing denoising diffusion models for self-supervised learning" caught my attention, as it explores the potential of diffusion models in self-supervised learning, an area I am keen to explore further. My research internships at Advanced Machine Intelligence Research Lab and MeDAL Lab, IIT Bombay, have equipped me with hands-on experience in investigating LLM reasoning capabilities and enhancing self-supervised learning frameworks, aligning with your research focus.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to and learning from your research group, particularly in areas related to robust visual intelligence and multimodal LLMs. I am confident that my skills in PyTorch, Python, and relevant project experiences make me a suitable candidate for your research group.

I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my application and research interests with you further. My CV, transcript, and portfolio are available for your reference.

Sincerely,
Arpon Kapuria
